**A Feature Selection-Driven Pipeline to Identify Compact Predictive Gene Panels Characterizing Drought and Heat Stress Responses in Rice**

### Overview

Rice (*Oryza sativa* L.) is one of the world's most important staple crops, yet its productivity is increasingly threatened by drought and heat stress. This repository provides the complete computational workflow used to identify compact predictive gene panels associated with drought and heat stress responses in rice.

The framework integrates RNA-seq data, feature selection methods, and classifiers to discover biologically meaningful and highly predictive gene signatures.

The final predictive gene panels consisted of:

* **10 genes** for drought stress classification
* **4 genes** for heat stress classification

Among all evaluated approaches, the combination of **Mutual Information-Minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance (MImRMR)** feature selection and **Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN)** achieved the highest predictive performance.

## Workflow

* RNA-seq Data → Feature Selection → Predictive Gene Panels → Classifiers → Performance Evaluation →
Independent dataset assessment → Biological interpretation

## Feature Selection Methods

The repository includes implementations of the following feature selection approaches:

### 1. Stability Selection (SS)

A subsampling-based feature selection framework that combines repeated random sampling with sparse logistic regression to identify features consistently selected across data partitions.

### 2. Boruta

An all-relevant feature selection method based on Random Forests and shadow features, designed to identify all biologically relevant genes associated with stress responses.

### 3. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)

Wrapper-based methods that iteratively remove less informative features and identify optimal gene subsets through cross-validation.

### 4. Mutual Information (MI)- Minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance (MImRMR)

An information-theoretic method that ranks genes according to their statistical dependence with the stress phenotype. Then simultaneously maximizes relevance to the target phenotype while minimizing redundancy among selected genes.

### 5. Embedded Gradient Boosting Feature Selection (EGBFS)

An embedded approach that ranks genes according to feature importance scores derived from gradient boosting classifiers.

### 6. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

An evolutionary optimization approach that searches for optimal gene subsets using selection, crossover, and mutation operators.

## Classifiers

### 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN)

Fully connected neural networks with extensive hyperparameter optimization including:

* Hidden layer architecture
* Learning rate
* Activation function

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

One-dimensional convolutional neural networks designed to learn local relationships among selected gene features.

## Software Requirements

The analyses were performed using Python and the following libraries:

```text
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost
boruta
joblib
scipy
```

## Reproducibility

All feature selection methods and deep learning models were evaluated using:

* Stratified 5-fold cross-validation
* F1-score as the primary evaluation metric
* Independent training and testing datasets
* Parameter optimization (tuning)

## Disclaimer

This repository contains computationally intensive feature selection and deep learning pipelines designed for research-scale RNA-seq analyses. Some workflows involve extensive hyperparameter searches, repeated cross-validation, evolutionary optimization, and neural network training.

Users are strongly encouraged to execute these analyses on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, dedicated workstations, or cloud computing platforms. Running the full workflow on resource-limited personal computers may result in excessive execution times, high memory consumption, or process termination due to insufficient computational resources.
